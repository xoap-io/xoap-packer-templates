## Introduction

This is the XOAP Packer repository.

It is part of our XOAP Automation Forces Open Source community library to give you a quick start into Infrastructure as Code deployments with Packer in addition to image.XO.

## Guidelines

We are using the following guidelines to write code and make it easier for everyone to follow a destinctive guideline. Please check these links before starting to work on changes.

Git Naming Conventions are an important part of the development process. They descrtibe how Branched, Commit Messages, Pull Requests and Tags should look like to make the easily understandebla for everybody in the development chain.

[Git Naming Conventions](https://namingconvention.org/git/)

he Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history; which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of.

[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

The better a Pull Request description is, the better a review can understand and decide on how to review the changes. This improves implementation speed and reduces communication between the requester and the reviewer resulting in much less overhead.

[Wiriting A Great Pull Request Description](https://www.pullrequest.com/blog/writing-a-great-pull-request-description/)

Versioning is a crucial part for Terraform Stacks and Modules. Without version tags you cannot clearly create a stable environment and be sure that your latest changes won't crash your production environment (sure it still can happen, but we are trying our best to implement everything that we can to reduce the risk)

[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org)

Naming Conventions for Terraform resources must be used.

## Usage

### Installation

For the first time using this template necessary tools need to be installed.
A script for PowerShell Core is provided under ./build/init.ps1

This script will install following dependencies:

- [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit)
- [terraform-docs](https://github.com/terraform-docs/terraform-docs)
- [tflint](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint)
- [tfsec](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tfsec)
- [checkov](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov)
- [terrascan](https://github.com/accurics/terrascan)
- [kics](https://github.com/Checkmarx/kics)

This script configures:

- global git template under ~/.git-template
- global pre-commit hooks for prepare-commit-msg and commit-msg under ~/.git-template/hooks
- github actions:
  - linting and checks for pull requests from dev to master/main
  - automatic tagging and release creation on pushes to master/main
  - dependabot updates

It currently supports the automated installation for macOS. Support for Windows and Linux will be available soon.

### Prerequisites

All of the available Packer configurations are provided "as is" without any warranty.

They where tested and run with the following infrastrcture:

- macOS Monterey 12.3.1
- Hashicorp Packer 1.8.0
- VMware Fusion Pro 12.3.3
- Windows 10 21H2 Enterprise with Hyper-V

### Windows Updates

The filters for the Windows Updates are set as follows:

filters = [
"exclude:$_.Title -like '*Preview*'",
"exclude:$_.Title -like '*Feature update*'",
"include:$true",
]

If you want your images to be updated to the latest feature level remove to following line:

"exclude:$\_.Title -like '_Feature update_'",
